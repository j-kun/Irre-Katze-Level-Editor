	first field is first field where the cat moves to (not the start field where it stands when the level is loaded)
	after pipe following y coordinates must be flipped.
	
	jumps can occur at:
		- pipe
			dx = 0
			dy = yAfterPipe - yBeforePipe with yAfterPipe = ROWS - 1 - yBeforePipe => dy = ROWS - 1 - 2*yBeforePipe
			=> jump and step are unambiguously separable
		- helium
			dx = 0
			dy < 0 # helium always moves upwards
			can not step downward, because there is the helium
			=> jump and step are unambiguously separable
	
	in most cases a jump is unambiguous, because:
		- you can't smoke a pipe if there is no pipe
		- helium can't push you upwards if there is no helium
		- jump can't be caused by pipe if dy does not match the calculation above
		- jump can't be caused by helium if dy >= 0 (cause helium always moves upwards)
		- helium only moves upward, not sideways => it can't be a helium jump if there is no helium below you
		  (this reasoning does not work for the pipe because it's subject to gravity and can slide to a neighbouring column)
	
	complications:
		- a combination is possible (first pipe jump and immediately afterwards a helium jump)
		- usually a helium jump can only occur if the entered field was untouched.
		  however scenarios are possible (I think) where 
		  (1) I visit a field A 
		  (2) something falls or is moved onto field A 
		  (3) I visit the field below A 
		  (4) when I leave the field below A the helium will float up 
		  (5) I visit field A, moving the object aside 
		  => a helium jump may happen although I have visited the field already.
		- a helium jump is possible even if I have not visited the fields above because they may have been activated by falling objects
	
	solution:
		- lines after the specified number of solution steps are ignored. I can use these to save the performed steps (rather than the coordinates).
	
	no jump at arrow (arrows are counted as two steps)
		(this is done wrong in the solution of irka-019.afg)
